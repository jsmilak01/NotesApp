## Notes

I was unable to use room library as every time I would put the dependencies in my file i got an error from the kapt and ksp dependencies. I tried to implement everything else as best as I could but the app does
function properly. I commented out my implementation of the room library classes and dependencies so my code is there but I was unable to get it working.
